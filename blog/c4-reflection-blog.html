      <h2>Why Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>Have been looking at the Dev Academy website off and on for 6 months wanting to take the plunge and learn new skills.  So, finally did.  Hope to one day work with a team of developers and also do some contract work as well.</p>

      <h3>Take on the DBC / EDA Experience:</h3>
        <p>What's your intake?<br>Bootcamp experience is different from the "schooling" usually received.  Taking on the journey is the approach of diving in and making a mess and learning by doing.</p>
        <p>What are your impressions?<br>I like learning by doing.  I've done the university process and learned from that experience basic tools, but once on the job I had to learn what wasn't taught to me that was specific to job requirements. It's like building a foundation of learning layer by layer over the years to come.</p>
        <p>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?<br>I'm hopeful that I can take on learning this learning style and continue with it after graduation.</p>
        <p>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so how?<br>My expectations were all over the place prior to starting.  I think over the past weeks I've been getting a better picture and will hopefully continue to do so.</p>
        <p>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br>I'm excited, nervous, apprehensive, hopeful, thrilled to finally doing it instead of just wondering and looking at your website.</p>
