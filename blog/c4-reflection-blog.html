      <h2>Where I live</h2>
      <p>I live in Lyall Bay in Wellington and have since 1996 when I moved here from Juneau, Alaska.</p>
      <h2>Family Life</h2>
      <p>I live with my husband, John and my 14 year old son, Evan and our very furry cat, Shyla.</p>
      <h2>Why Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p>Have been looking at the Dev Academy website off and on for 6 months wanting to take the plunge and learn new skills.  So, finally did.  Hope to one day work with a team of developers and also do some contract work as well.</p>
