      <h2>Take on the DBC / EDA Experience:</h2>
      <h3>What's your intake?</h3>
      <p>
        Bootcamp experience is different from the "schooling" usually received.  Taking on the journey is the approach of diving in and making a mess and learning by doing.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>
        I like learning by doing.  I've done the university process and learned from that experience basic tools, but once on the job I had to learn what wasn't taught to me that was specific to job requirements. It's like building a foundation of learning layer by layer over the years to come.
      </p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm hopeful that I can take on learning this learning style and continue with it after graduation.
      </p>
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so how?</h3>
      <p>
        My expectations were all over the place prior to starting.  I think over the past weeks I've been getting a better picture and will hopefully continue to do so.
      </p>
      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm excited, nervous, apprehensive, hopeful, thrilled to finally doing it instead of just wondering and looking at your website.
