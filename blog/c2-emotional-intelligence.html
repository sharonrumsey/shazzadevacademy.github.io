        <h1>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 4</h1>
      </div>
          <h2>Did you connect with any of the analogies for the mind?</h2>
            <p>
              I can connect with the understanding that none of us are perfect, but we can achieve what we set our minds on - you don't have to be perfect.  But you do need to know your strengths and weaknesses to better go about achieving your goals.  Through that you can harness co-workers strengths along with your own to achieve goals. Self-assessment and the confidence gained through this knowledge isn&#39;t easy but possible.              
            </p>
          <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
            <p>
               &ldquo;Body Scan - Functions at the level of physiology and works best for developing emotional awareness.&rdquo;<br>
               &ldquo;Journaling, function at the level of meaning and works best for developing self-assessment.&rdquo;<br>
               &ldquo;These two practices create the condition for self-confidence.&rdquo;<br><br>
               Body Scanning and Journaling can be used to help focus on being mindful of your thoughts and emotions.  It's also nice to take time for self reflection and then through journaling look back on your thoughts and how you have developed your mindfulness overtime.
            </p>
          <h2>How did you find the body scanning?</h2>
            <p>
               I was taught this in psychology classes long ago when I attended university.  It's a relaxation technique we would use to help a person come more into the moment and to tap in on personal issues or to focus on them and what they need.  Also focusing on breathing helps to funnel your thoughts and to keep your mind from wondering off.  
            </p>
          <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h2>
            <p>
              &ldquo;Self Awareness is Mindfulness.&rdquo;<br><br>I like using different prompts to direct thought through journaling.  Also the reading noted that you allow yourself to become angry or sad and that people do not make you respond that way.  You should own your own emotion and not attribute it to others or towards actions in your life.
