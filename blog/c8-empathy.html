        <li>Try the 'Just Like Me' and 'Loving Kindness' practices. How did you feel?</li>
          <p>
            I like giving the thought of kindess and equality to others.  It' a calming technique in my mind.  It also gives some direction in the form of meditating to others and in a sense to give them energy for goodness, happiness and health.

          <p>
            I wish I had more time for energy work and meditation.

        <li>Try the Traditional Practice of Loving Kindness - Did you prefer this technique?</li>
          <p>May I be well.</p>
          <p>May I be happy.</p>
          <p>May I be free from suffering.</p>
          <p>May I someday be really good at JavaScript</p>
          <p>
            I don't often take the time to think of others that I "do not like" - I feel like that is wasted energy, but I understand that giving good energy to all is better than to reserve for just a few and it is an enlightenment for yourself

            I've had co-workers and clients in the past that were very difficult to work with and I did my best not to internalize issues I had with them.  I wished them better performance and better ability, but I'd rather concentrate on my own performance than to continually evaluate and review theirs.

          Have you been in a situation in which Empathetic Listening could have improved conversation?  Or, describe a situation where empathetic listening practices worked well
        </li>
          <p>
            I used to work as a psychologist and a case manager in mental health outpatient.  I think I've practiced empathetic listening a lot and I would develop my working relationship with clients starting out with a list of understanding to help develop trust and reassuring them that they are indeed a part of their treatment and expected to participate and will be heard.  It's not always an easy approach, but this foundation is necessary to help in treatment and developing a good treatment relationship, especially since I would be a witness to clients difficulties and vulnerable situations.  They needed to know that I would be consistent in my approach and that they would know what to expect - that helps develop trust.

        <li>Give an example of "person praise" and "process praise"</li>
          <p>
            I once had a young client that initially wanted nothing to do with me.  Through the process I helped him access services and become well enough to attend university courses along with getting a job and developing friendships.  It got to the point that I felt he no longer required my help or our services and that he was fine on his own.  I told him that he needed to fire me.  This young person who initally wanted nothing to do with me became upset and left the room.  A few weeks later he returned to my office and announce quite loudly "You're Fired!".  I was so pleased and he was thrilled that he had done so well.  I assured him he did most of the work and his effort was the reason he no longer needed our services.  It was a great day to celebrate.
