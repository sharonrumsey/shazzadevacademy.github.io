  <h1>C7 Motivation</h1>
    <h2>How does life look through the &#145;pleasure, passion and purpose&#146; lens?</h2>
      <p class="indent"><em><strong>Pleasure - Passion - Purpose</em></strong></p>
      <p class="indent">
        I would think that life would be pretty wonderful if work involves the pursuit of pleasure, 
        passion and purpose.  I&#146;ve had many jobs in my life and have never achieved all three at 
        once.  I&#146;ve had passion and purpose, but to find the pleasure has been difficult.  Chasing
        the rock star high has been elusive to me.  I&#146;ve always dreamed of working in an 
        evnironment that engaged creativity and achievement.

    <h2>From the &#145;discovering values and higher purpose&#146; exercise:</h2>
    <h2 class="indent">What are your core values?</h2>
      <p class="indent underline">My core values are:<br></p>
      <p class="indent">
        Honesty - Integrity - Dependability<br>My core values have developed overtime to become stronger 
        as I age.  It's a process of knowing more of who you are as a person and how that person has 
        developed going through life stressors and challenges.</p>
    <h2 class ="indent">What do you stand for?</h2>
      <p class="indent underline">I stand for:<br></p>
      <p class="indent">
        Growth and development. Equality. You never know everything and if you remain open to knowledge
        then I believe you are a happier person. I grew up in a small town in Indiana. I am glad that I 
        left and wasn't influenced by the small mindedness of my surroundings. I grew past their
        thinking and I believe I am happier in my life due to that. Basically glad I didn't turn into a Trump supporter.</p>

    <h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
      <p class="indent"><em>&#34;Resilience is the ability to overcome obstacles along the way. Alignment and envisioning help you find out wher you want to go, and rsilience help you get there.&#34; </em></p>
      <p class="indent">Use of the training on resilience on three levels:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inner Calm - reaching inside your mind in a way to access mind training to provide optimisim and resilience - finding the path in yourself to achieve no matter what. Achieved by training in mindfulness.</li>
          <li>Emotional Resilience - You need to own your own emotion and your own emotional response.  In my mind there is a fear of failure and a hope to succeed.  Emotional resilience is training to stop your fear learned from past experience stop you from trying. And concentrating on moments of success help and recognizing that the experience is simply that - an experience.  We all have failures in our lives and those failures are experiences to be learned from.</li>
          <li>Cognitive Resilience - Develops optimism.  Even with many experiences in our lives of failure it's important to develop optimisim to continue to achieve and make the effort to try.  We need to learn and establish optimism in our thoughts and unlearn pessimism pickedup in our life.</li>
        </ol>
      <p class="indent">Learning Optimism by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be aware of your own strong negative experiential bias.  Acknowledge and focus on your successes in life.</li>
          <li>Mindfulness - Create objectivity toward your experiences.  Your body manifests emotions vividly so your mindfulness needs to review those emotions objectively.</li>
        </ol>

      <p class="indent">Being more mindful and objective and optimistic sounds wonderous and wonderful.</p>
