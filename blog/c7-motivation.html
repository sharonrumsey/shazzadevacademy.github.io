    <h2>How does life look through the &#145;pleasure, passion and purpose&#146; lens?</h2>
      <p><em><strong>Pleasure - Passion - Purpose</em></strong></p>
      <p>I would think that life would be pretty wonderful if work involves the pursuit of pleasure, passion and purpose.  I&#146;ve had many jobs in my life and have never achieved all three at once.  I&#146;ve had passion and purpose, but to find the pleasure has been difficult.  Chasing the rock star high has been elusive to me.  I&#146;ve always dreamed of working in an evnironment that engaged creativity and achievement.</p>
