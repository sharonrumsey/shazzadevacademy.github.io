  <h1>C7 Motivation</h1>
    <h2>How does life look through the &#145;pleasure, passion and purpose&#146; lens?</h2>
      <p class="indent"><em><strong>Pleasure - Passion - Purpose</em></strong></p>
      <p class="indent">
        I would think that life would be pretty wonderful if work involves the pursuit of pleasure, 
        passion and purpose.  I&#146;ve had many jobs in my life and have never achieved all three at 
        once.  I&#146;ve had passion and purpose, but to find the pleasure has been difficult.  Chasing
        the rock star high has been elusive to me.  I&#146;ve always dreamed of working in an 
        evnironment that engaged creativity and achievement.

    <h2>From the &#145;discovering values and higher purpose&#146; exercise:</h2>
    <h2 class="indent">What are your core values?</h2>
      <p class="indent underline">My core values are:<br></p>
      <p class="indent">
        Honesty - Integrity - Dependability<br>My core values have developed overtime to become stronger 
        as I age.  It's a process of knowing more of who you are as a person and how that person has 
        developed going through life stressors and challenges.</p>
    <h2 class ="indent">What do you stand for?</h2>
      <p class="indent underline">I stand for:<br></p>
      <p class="indent">
        Growth and development. Equality. You never know everything and if you remain open to knowledge
        then I believe you are a happier person. I grew up in a small town in Indiana. I am glad that I 
        left and wasn't influenced by the small mindedness of my surroundings. I grew past their
        thinking and I believe I am happier in my life due to that.</p>
