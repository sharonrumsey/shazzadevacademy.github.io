      <li>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</li>
        <p>HTML is like the nouns on the page, CSS is the adjectives and JavaScript is the verbs.</p>

      <li>
        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
      </li>
        <p>
          It's like looking at a flowchart and the codes taking more than one path - so different code runs under different situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHILE LOOP -- It starts by making a decision of what you want to do.  In a basic while loop you will sit down to eat a bowl of cereal but with a goal of eating to the bottom of the bowl.  In the While Loop you continue the activity with the loop running until the loop goal is completed - no more cereal.  So, the loop continues over and over of scooping the spoon and lifting cereal to your mouth - as true - until it's false and there is no more cereal.
        </p>
        <p>
          FOR LOOP -- Is a different way of producing the same looping behavior.  You start with initialization of a full bowl then you eat the spoonfuls of cereal until you reach the number of spoonfuls of the full bowl and that number is a plus of eating one spoonful at a time.  And this measure is checked after every spoonful until completion is achieved.

      <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</li>
        <p>
          Everything in JavaScript is an object - Arrays, Functions and even numbers.  A JavaScript object is a basic data structure.  To access data in the object literal you put it equal in {} and list them as key value pairs.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Arrays are a type of object that is used for storing multiple values in a single variable.  Each value gets numeric index and may be any data type.  To access data in the array you can use methods such as push(), splice(), pop(). Arrays are put in [].
        </p>

      <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</li>
        <p>Functions bundle instructions together.  Functions can reuse code many times and can do so with different arguments to produce different results. </p>
          <hr>
      <li>With an example, explain the difference between 'functional' and 'object oriented' programming.</li>
