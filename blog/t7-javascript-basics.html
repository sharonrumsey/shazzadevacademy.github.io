  <h1>As if talking to a non-tech friend, discuss:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</li>
        <p>HTML is like the nouns on the page, CSS is the adjectives and JavaScript is the verbs.</p>
          <hr>
      <li>
        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
      </li>
        <p>
          It's like looking at a flowchart and the codes taking more than one path - so different code runs under different situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHILE LOOP -- It starts by making a decision of what you want to do.  In a basic while loop you will sit down to eat a bowl of cereal but with a goal of eating to the bottom of the bowl.  In the While Loop you continue the activity with the loop running until the loop goal is completed - no more cereal.  So, the loop continues over and over of scooping the spoon and lifting cereal to your mouth - as true - until it's false and there is no more cereal.
        </p>
        <p>
          FOR LOOP -- Is a different way of producing the same looping behavior.  You start with initialization of a full bowl then you eat the spoonfuls of cereal until you reach the number of spoonfuls of the full bowl and that number is a plus of eating one spoonful at a time.  And this measure is checked after every spoonful until completion is achieved.

      <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</li>
        <p>
          Everything in JavaScript is an object - Arrays, Functions and even numbers.  A JavaScript object is a basic data structure.  To access data in the object literal you put it equal in {} and list them as key value pairs.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Arrays are a type of object that is used for storing multiple values in a single variable.  Each value gets numeric index and may be any data type.  To access data in the array you can use methods such as push(), splice(), pop(). Arrays are put in [].
        </p>
          <hr>
      <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</li>
        <p>Functions bundle instructions together.  Functions can reuse code many times and can do so with different arguments to produce different results. </p>
          <hr>
      <li>With an example, explain the difference between 'functional' and 'object oriented' programming.</li>
        <p>
          OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING - are good when you have a fixed set of operations on things and as your code evolves you can add new things though classes - leaving existing classes alone.  Basically asking the question of 'What can I do with the data?'  
        </p>
        <p>
          As per Stackoverflow: Object-oriented languages are good when you have a fixed set of <em>operations on things,</em> and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things.  This can be accomplished by adding new classes which implement existing methods, and the exsting classes are left alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per Wikipedia: OOP is based on the concept of objects, whihch are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.  A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object wth which they are associated.  In OO</p>
        <p>
          FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING - are good when you have a fixed set of things and as your code evolves you can add new operations on existing things.  Basically asking the question 'How is the data constructed?'  The advantages ae the increased readability and more easily maintained.  
        </p>
        <p>
          As per Stackoverflow: Functional languages are good when you have a fixed set of <em>things</em>, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new <em>operations</em> on existing things. This can be accomplished by adding new functions which compute with existing data types, and the existing functions are left alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per Wikipedia: In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time. Eliminating side effects, i.e. changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So for an example - I searched for ideas of this and found <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/object-oriented-programming-vs-functional-programming">The Codenewbie Blog</a>- it gave a good example of how FP uses less code and doesn't fiddle with previous arrays data when developing new arrays.  At the bottom he refers to Michael fogus observation that FP works well when dealing with data about people, but OOP works better when our data is about people.
