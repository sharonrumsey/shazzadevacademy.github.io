    <h1>After 8 sprints:</h1><hr>
      <h2>Which concepts did you find most difficult?</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is still difficult for me - for the life of me if I had to sit down and write something in JavaScript I basically don't know where to begin.  I can reverse engineer really well and I think I've improved a lot on being able to read it.  But just knowing where to start and is baffling for me still.  But just seeing the end product - I'm like "yea totally see it".  I think I might be stressing a lot over this.  But I plan to perservere and to keep at it.  I really enjoy seeing the end product.  And I certainly have a great appreciation of web pages now and probably have become a bit of a web page snob.

      <h2>Which skills / concepts do you feel still confused by? (Don't worry, we don't expect you to have mastered evrything!)</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript.  Also jQuery - I'm not certain where JavaScript begins - I know they are interconnected in a way, but I can't tell them apart.
        </p><hr>
      <h2>Which skills / concepts do you feel you understand the best?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm quite comfortable with html and css - I know I don't know everything about them, but I'm more able to integrate new things I find with html and css.  
        </p><hr>
      <h2>Which aspects of web development so far do you enjoy the most?</h2>
        <p>I like learning and setting my milestones by what I've learned.  I think I'll really enjoy working with a team or pair programming once I am more confident in my coding.  I'm really looking forward mostly to the team work and creating something from nothing.</p>
