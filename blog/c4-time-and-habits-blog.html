    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>
      Starting Small for me is best place to begin. I like things to be broken down into their parts with a general view of the final project in mind.  It's easiest for me to make lists in planning ahead and then breaking tasks to complete within lists.  Starting small means to me having a better grasp and so hopefully things won't get out-of-head or seem to big.<br>Coding everyday and typing it everyday will help me pick up skill and confidence.

    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>
      It's interesting see names of individuals like Richard Branson and to know and realize they had to start at the beginning as well - somewhere small.

    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>
     I try to take the approach I feel most confident in adopting.  As in writing you should write what you know.  Begin coding and taking on projects you should start with what you know and build on that.  Always building and learning is really the goal - and you can never know it all.  Accepting that is key.
