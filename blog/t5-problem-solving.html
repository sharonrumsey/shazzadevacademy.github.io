      <p class="numbered">Got stuck on a simple problem</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What was the problem?</strong> --> I'm sorry but I'm not sure I've encountered "simiple" problems so far.  But when I did have difficulty I would try to work it through in my mind or type "nonsense" code in summing up what I thought was required or at least putting in comments of what steps I thought it would require.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What problem solving techiniques did you use?</strong> --> I start with reviewing it and thinking about the steps it would need.  Then I basically read over the question and use google to search like questions.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> --> I like being inquisitive and trying to solve problems.  I like the accomplishment of solving and learning through the process.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What did you learn?</strong> --> I learned that you need to perservere and try different approaches and pull information from different sources.  Also, it's important to try for a time, but to take break and do something else and then return to the problem.  This approach helps me.

      <p class="numbered">Solved a problem in an elegant way</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What was the problem?</strong> --> The most recent problem was when running this web page it kept coming up invalid due to putting p tags inside lists (inline problem).  So, went searching for other options so I could validate and found giving it a class as numbered gave some questions numbers.  Nice to learn, but retaining specific set information is hard for me if I don't repeatly use it. So, couldn't just set at a pc and type that again without making reference to it.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What problem solving techiniques did you use?</strong> -->  Google is now my best friend.  Can't believe I grew up without it.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> --> I feel good about the process.  I've used this process a lot since my first computer back in 1996.  I feel very comfortable using the Google search engine.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What did you learn?</strong> --> There is always a different approach to try.  Somethings you find in a Google search are rubbish.  You try them and they don't work.  Then you just look for another solution to try.
