     <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-down" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <p class="numbered">Got stuck on a simple problem</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What was the problem?</strong> --> I'm sorry but I'm not sure I've encountered "simiple" problems so far.  But when I did have difficulty I would try to work it through in my mind or type "nonsense" code in summing up what I thought was required or at least putting in comments of what steps I thought it would require.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What problem solving techiniques did you use?</strong> --> I start with reviewing it and thinking about the steps it would need.  Then I basically read over the question and use google to search like questions.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> --> I like being inquisitive and trying to solve problems.  I like the accomplishment of solving and learning through the process.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What did you learn?</strong> --> I learned that you need to perservere and try different approaches and pull information from different sources.  Also, it's important to try for a time, but to take break and do something else and then return to the problem.  This approach helps me.
        </p><hr>

      <p class="numbered">Solved a problem in an elegant way</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What was the problem?</strong> --> The most recent problem was when running this web page it kept coming up invalid due to putting p tags inside lists (inline problem).  So, went searching for other options so I could validate and found giving it a class as numbered gave some questions numbers.  Nice to learn, but retaining specific set information is hard for me if I don't repeatly use it. So, I couldn't just set at a pc and type that again without making reference to it.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What problem solving techiniques did you use?</strong> -->  Google is now my best friend.  Can't believe I grew up without it.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> --> I feel good about the process.  I've used this process a lot since my first computer back in 1996.  I feel very comfortable using the Google search engine.  Actually I found my husband through a Google search.  We both have the same surname and when I ran it through Google in 1996 it popped up 15 finds.  Yes, just 15.  And I wrote to a few and my husband and I just kept writing and things evolved from there.
        </p><hr>
        <p>
          <strong>What did you learn?</strong> --> There is always a different approach to try.  Somethings you find in a Google search are rubbish.  You try them and they don't work.  Then you just look for another solution to try.

            I'm okay with the a class psuedo a:hover and I've worked one into this web page, but I haven't used them much so my confidence isn't very high.

          <p class="indent">
            I like trying new stuff and new approaches - I actually find it fun.  Unfortunately it takes loads of my time and I have homework and other things to do as well.

          <p class="indent">
            I talk to my cat and she talks back to me in meowscript.  Together I'm hopefull we can solve problems together.  And in the process of saying outloud I do find some helpful review of the problem.

        <p class="unordered"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true">Reading Error Messages</span></p>
          <p class="indent">
            I'm getting better at using the console to check on errors in code.  Some of the errors have been puzzling to read.  But at least they refer to line of code that gives the error.  That is very helpful.
          </p>
        <p class="unordered"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true">Console.log</span></p>
          <p class="indent">
            I find it useful to put it in code to check that what I've written is working.  Console.log and Google are my best buds.  I just need to use it more to find more aspects of it helpful. 
          </p>
        <p class="unordered"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true">Googling</span></p>
          <p class="indent">
            Google is wonderful and I used it everyday and not just for coding.  I like finding solutions.  So, I feel very comfortable and capable using Google.

          <p class="indent">
            I need to do this more.  I tend to be independent and dive in trying to figure it out on my own with the tools I have and I need to think more about people I work with being tools I can access as well.

            Once I'm at bootcamp I'll probably utilize coaches for help more....probably a lot.

          <p class="indent">
            Reflection is good and something I use everyday in building my confidence for this course.  I look back and think about what I've learned so far and I'm amazed by how much I've learned already.

      <h1 class="numbered">Explain to your non-tech friend -- Describe what these functions do in your own words:</h1>
        <p class="unordered"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-picture" aria-hidden="true"><strong>.map()</strong></span></p>
          <p class="indent">
            This method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this arrary<br><br>
            Map processes through each item in an array or objects and calls back or returns a value(s) as a new array.  Particularly usefull when you wish to return values from specific inputs or object lists.  Callback - Function that produces an element of the new Array, taking three agruments (currentValue, index, array).
          </p>
        <p class="unordered"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-filter" aria-hidden="true"><strong>.filter()</strong></span></p>
          <p class="indent">
            Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.<br><br>It goes through the array and pulls back a value of a new array showing true for the argument. (currentValue, index, array)
          </p>
        <p class="unordered"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus" aria-hidden="true"><strong>.reduce()</strong></span></p>
          <p class="indent">
            This method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.<br><br>Goes through the array taking the argument and brings back a single value. (currentValue, index, array) 
          </p><hr>
        <h1 class="numbered">In a 20 minute timebox, have a go at explaining how recursion compares to iteration.</h1>
        <p class="unordered"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign" aria-hidden="true"><strong>In your own words</strong></span></p>
          <p class="indent">
            Truthfully I had to look this up before I could even attempt to explain it.<br><br>Iteration and Recursion can perform the same kinds of tasks.  Basically solve a complicated task one piece at a tiime and then combine the results.   
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            <strong>Iteration --></strong> Keeps repeating until the task is done doing so in a loop until it reaches false.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            <strong>Recursion --></strong> To solve the problem it breaks it down into smaller pieces and then solves and combines the results.  Also is an issue that it takes more cpu to process.  It calls itself again to repeat the code.
