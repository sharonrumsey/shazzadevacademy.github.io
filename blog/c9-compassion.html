    <h2>What are your thoughts about the compassion training?</h2>
      <h3>Compassion has 3 components:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A cognitive component: "I understand you"</li>
        <li>An effective component: "I feel for you"</li>
        <li>A motivational component: "I want to help you"</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I only wish more people would practice compassion towards others.  It's a wonderful thought and something we should all practice.

    <h2>Give a short summary of each of the components of the SCARF model of social behaviour.</h2>
      <p>The SCARF Model for the Social Brain</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Status --> relative importance, pecking order or seniority</li>
          <li>Certainty --> continuity of the familiar creates happiness and less stress</li>
          <li>
            Autonomy --> perception of exerting control over one's environment - decrease amounts of feeling helpless
          </li>
          <li>
            Relatedness --> perception of whether another person is a "friend" or "foe" - how connected we feel towards others
          </li>
          <li>
            Fairness --> people don't always react in fair ways, this is a human trait.  Sometimes sense of fairness if such a subjective opinion that you need to evaluate others sense of "fair play" to understand how they will respond.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>
      Difficult conversations and mindful emailing (or slacking!) are highly important at EDA. Is there an example in your life where you applied/didn't apply these concepts?  How did you feel about it?
    </h2>
      <p>
        I'm sure there are many examples of both in everyone's lives, especially as the digital world has impacted every aspect of our daily function.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have many examples of difficult conversations from past work experiences.  I was always aware of the "fight or flight syndrome" in human nature.  So, I always made sure that someone didn't have to go through me to get to the door during some very difficult conversations.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And over time I've become more aware how perception can color how people read emails these days.  I'm certain that some people have read what I've written and taken it in a different light in which it was intended.  What is important is that you "own" what you've written and how you wrote it and if there is a difficult conversation about it you should apologize of any offense was made.  And then make note of how to word or approach this individual in the future.  I know that my sarcastic comments have many a time been taken the wrong way.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm never happy if other's feel that my approach was different than I intended it to be and I am happy to chat with them regarding their perception of my verbal approach or digital communication.
